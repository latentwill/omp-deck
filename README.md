# omp-deck

A cockpit web UI for the [oh-my-pi](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi)
(`omp`) coding agent. Multi-session chat with full tool-call rendering, a
kanban backed by SQLite, cron routines, an inbox with one-click promote, a
plugin marketplace, themable settings, and a Telegram bridge — all in a single
Bun process, designed to run loopback-only behind Tailscale or an SSH tunnel.

> Status: **v0.2 release — KB Cockpit + Maintenance Gate.**
> See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for the full feature inventory.

## Why

The omp TUI is excellent at what it does, but a terminal isn't always where
you want to drive an agent — you might want a kanban to track its work, a
phone bridge to ask it things from the couch, a marketplace to install
plugins without hand-editing JSON, or just a calmer surface for long
sessions. omp-deck gives you all of that while reusing the SDK in-process so
the chat itself stays at parity with the TUI.

omp-deck is **not** a replacement for `omp`. It embeds the same SDK and
shares its session + auth store. Run both; they coexist.

## Highlights

- **Chat** with multi-session sidebar, per-tool renderers (`read` / `write` /
  `edit` / `bash` / `search` / `lsp` / `task` / `eval` / `web_search` /
  `todo_write` / `generate_image` / `browser`), thinking blocks, hashline
  diff coloring, cost rollup, image paste/drop/attach, compaction +
  auto-retry indicators.
- **Slash commands** with four scopes (`deck` / `builtin` / `user` /
  `project`) and in-process dispatch — `/task add`, `/context`, `/compact`,
  `/usage` run instantly with no model round-trip.
- **Knowledge base** — `/kb` view over your local Karpathy-style llm-wiki at
  `~/kb` (override via `OMP_DECK_KB_ROOT`). Lazy tree, markdown viewer with
  `[[wikilink]]` resolution + create-on-click, in-pane editor, Obsidian-
  style force-directed graph view (`?view=graph`) with click-to-isolate per
  source directory, full-text search + Ctrl-P quick-open palette, inspector
  with outbound links + backlinks + tag chips + orphan badge. Empty kb
  surfaces a one-click setup flow. Hide subtrees with
  `OMP_DECK_KB_EXCLUDE_DIRS=<csv>`.
- **Skills** — `/skills` surfaces every skill omp loads across all providers
  (`native`, `claude-plugins`, `claude`, `codex`, …), not just marketplace
  plugins. Native (`~/.omp/agent/skills/`) sorts first. Ships an omp-native
  `create-skill` starter — first-party authoring loop with no Claude-Code
  dependencies.
- **Maintenance gate** — bundled omp SDK extension (installed to
  `~/.omp/agent/extensions/` on boot) that nudges the agent at turn-end
  (~every 10 turns) to capture reusable output into the canonical org
  folders (`inbox/`, `tasks/`, `knowledge/`, `queries/`, `context/`, …)
  or state "No maintenance needed" to release. Structural org-root sniff
  only activates for cwds with the canonical layout. Universal across
  deck, omp TUI, and ACP sessions (the deck wires `ExtensionRunner` into
  `InProcessAgentBridge`).
- **Kanban** with Jira-style display IDs (`T-1`, `T-2`, ...), drag-and-drop,
  configurable columns, and live WebSocket broadcasts — agent or external
  scripts mutating tasks refresh every open kanban without polling.
- **Routines V1** — multi-step pipelines, not single-action cron jobs. A
  routine is a typed YAML spec with `run` / `agent` / `http` / `write` / `deck`
  / `mcp` / `transform` / `wait` / `set_state` steps plus four trigger kinds
  (`cron`, `webhook`, `manual`, `event`). Author them visually in the new
  **canvas builder** (drag, drop, wire branches with `if`-flavored nodes),
  in form mode, or directly as YAML — all three round-trip the same spec.
  Live run observability paints per-step status rings, durations, and model
  / cost badges on the canvas; node-click opens the captured `stdout` /
  `stderr` / structured JSON. Ships with a `daily-briefing` template that
  hits the deck's own kanban + inbox and writes a morning summary back via
  the `deck` action steps.
- **Inbox** — quick capture surface with promote-to-task.
- **Settings** — masked secret store with atomic `.env` writes + audit log,
  hot-applied env updates where possible, a one-click server restart for the
  rest. Paper / Slate / Horizon themes with FOUC-free pre-paint.
- **Marketplace** — browse and install plugins/skills/MCPs over the SDK's
  `MarketplaceManager`. Empty state seeds with
  `anthropics/claude-plugins-official`.
- **Model picker** — chat-header modal listing every model the SDK knows
  about, default-filtered to ones with configured auth, provider-grouped.
- **Telegram bridge** — standalone Bun process supervised by the deck; DM the
  agent from your phone with allowlist gating and streaming `editMessageText`
  replies.

## How it compares

omp-deck only makes sense as a pair with the
[`omp`](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi) coding agent — omp is the agent
loop, omp-deck is the cockpit you drive it from. Compared against the closest
neighbors in the agentic-coding space:

The short version: **Claude Code** is the polished, vendor-supported terminal
experience for Claude. **Hermes** is the self-improving agent that compounds
skills over time and supports serverless backends. **OpenClaw** is the
multi-channel personal assistant that lives wherever you message from.
**omp + omp-deck** is the cockpit shape — a model-agnostic coding agent in
your terminal *plus* a kanban / multi-step routines with a visual builder /
inbox / knowledge-base cockpit / marketplace / Telegram-bridge web surface
to drive it.

## Quickstart

### If you already use omp on this machine

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bjb2/omp-deck.git
cd omp-deck
bun install
bun run dev
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:5173>. Your existing `~/.omp/agent` is picked up
automatically — no re-auth.

On Windows, you can also double-click `Start-OMP-Deck.cmd` from the repo root.
It starts the background API server on <http://127.0.0.1:8787>, starts the
Vite web app on <http://127.0.0.1:5173>, opens the deck in your browser, and
writes process logs under `.logs/`.

### If you don't have omp yet

See [docs/install.md](./docs/install.md). The short version:

```sh
# 1. Install Bun (https://bun.sh)
# 2. Install the omp CLI globally so you can authenticate
bun add -g @oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent
omp                                          # interactive auth (browser OAuth or API key)
# 3. Clone and run the deck
git clone https://github.com/bjb2/omp-deck.git
cd omp-deck
bun install
bun run dev
```

Or skip the CLI entirely and paste your provider API key into Settings →
Env after the deck is up.

## Architecture in two lines

A Bun + Hono backend embeds `@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent`. The Vite + React
frontend is a pure consumer of a WebSocket event stream. The contract layer
(`packages/protocol`) is dep-free shared types.

```

   ├─ Hono routes  /api/{sessions, tasks, routines, inbox, settings,
   │                     models, marketplace, bridges, slash-commands, fs}
   ├─ WebSocket hub  /ws  (session events + tasks_changed broadcasts)
   ├─ Routines runner (croner)
   ├─ BridgeSupervisor (telegram bridge, future Slack/Discord)
   └─ MarketplaceService (SDK MarketplaceManager wrapper)
```

## Security

The deck ships **without an auth layer**. Bind it loopback-only (the default)
and front it with Tailscale Serve / SSH tunnel / a reverse proxy. The
hardening checklist in [docs/deployment.md](./docs/deployment.md#hardening-checklist)
covers what to verify before exposing the deck to a network anyone else can
reach.

Provider API keys live in env vars (your shell, or the deck-managed `.env`).
The Settings UI masks them by default; revealing a secret requires a loopback
request. The deck never logs values, only redacted forms.

## Status & roadmap

**v0.2 shipped:**

- KB Cockpit (tree / viewer / editor / graph / search / inspector) over
  `~/kb` with live updates.
- Skills cockpit pivoted to omp-native (`loadCapability` over all providers).
- Bundled `create-skill` and `maintenance-gate` starters; deck installs
  them on boot and `InProcessAgentBridge` now wires `ExtensionRunner` so
  extensions actually fire in deck sessions.
- Horizon theme (ported from
  [opus-extensions/omp-themes/horizon.json](https://github.com/vincitamore/misc/tree/main/opus-extensions/omp-themes)).
- External links open in a new tab across every markdown surface.
- CRLF-tolerant frontmatter parsing fixes Windows-saved YAML.
- Interactive `ask` tool bridged into the web UI via the new `ext_ui_dialog_*`
  WS frames — the agent can now ask the user mid-execution and receive
  selections / free-form text. Same channel also powers any extension calling
  `ctx.ui.select / editor / confirm / input`.

**Still deferred:**

- Plan-mode UI (banner + plan file viewer).
- File browser in the inspector.
- Subprocess-per-session bridge impl for crash isolation.
- Slack / Discord / Matrix bridges (same supervisor pattern as Telegram).
- `bunx omp-deck` install path / Docker image build verified.
