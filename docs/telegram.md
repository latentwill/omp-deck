# Telegram bridge

The Telegram bridge lets you chat with the omp agent from any Telegram
client — phone, desktop, web. DMs to your bot create or resume an omp
session keyed by `chat_id`; the agent's replies stream back via Telegram's
`editMessageText`.

The bridge is a **standalone Bun process** in `apps/bridges/telegram/`,
supervised by the deck server. Crashing the bridge does not affect the
deck or any in-flight chat sessions.

## Why standalone?

- Telegram long-polling has its own lifecycle (rate limits, transient 5xx,
  occasional 429s). Isolating it from the deck server keeps a single
  Telegram hiccup from interrupting the chat UI.
- The bridge can be restarted independently when you change credentials.

## Setup

### 1. Create the bot

Talk to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram. Send `/newbot`,
pick a name and username, copy the bot token he gives you. It looks like:

```
1234567890:ABCdefGHIJklmnopQRSTuvwxyz
```

### 2. Find your numeric user ID

Telegram usernames are not enough — the bridge allowlist needs the numeric
user ID. Message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) on Telegram. It
echoes your ID back, like `987654321`.

If multiple people will DM the bot, collect each of their IDs.

### 3. Save the credentials in the deck

Open the deck, navigate to **Settings → Messaging → Telegram**.

- **Bot token** — paste the token. Saved masked.
- **Allowed users** — comma-separated numeric IDs (e.g. `987654321,123456789`).

Both must be set. The bridge refuses to start without them.

### 4. Start the bridge

Click **Start** in the Telegram card. The status pill flips to **RUNNING**,
showing the pid and uptime. Expand **Bridge logs** to confirm
`telegram bridge started` lands within a second.

### 5. Send a DM to your bot

Open Telegram, search for the bot username, hit Start, send any message.
Within a few seconds the bridge:

1. Creates a new omp session at `OMP_DECK_DEFAULT_CWD` (or the cwd of the
   chat-to-session mapping if you've messaged the bot before).
2. Forwards your text as a prompt.
3. Streams the agent's reply back, edited in real-time via
   `editMessageText` to avoid spamming you with one message per token.

If the agent's reply exceeds Telegram's 4096-char message cap, the bridge
chunks it across multiple messages.

## Image attachments

Send a photo with an optional caption. The bridge downloads the largest
size, base64-encodes it, and forwards it as an omp `ImageAttachment` on the
prompt frame. The agent can `read` it like any other image.

## `/reset`

Send `/reset` in the Telegram chat. The bridge disposes the current omp
session and drops the chat→session mapping. The next message starts a fresh
session.

## Persistent chat→session map

The mapping lives at `<dataDir>/telegram-bridge.db` (SQLite). It survives
deck restarts so your conversation with the bot picks up across sessions.

To reset: `rm <dataDir>/telegram-bridge.db` while the bridge is stopped, then
restart it.

## Operations

| What | How |
|---|---|
| Start | Settings → Messaging → Telegram → Start |
| Stop | Settings → Messaging → Telegram → Stop |
| Restart (after token change) | Restart button (or Stop then Start) |
| View logs | Toggle "Bridge logs" in the Telegram card |
| Crash detection | Status pill flips to **CRASHED** with the exit code; crash count increments. Click Start to retry. |

The deck supervises the child process — when the deck server shuts down
(`Ctrl+C` or `/api/server/restart`), the bridge child is killed via
`safeShutdown`. There's no orphaned process after a clean exit.

## What's not in v1

- **Group chats**. DM-only.
- **Multi-user routing**. Single owner, single bot. If two people in
  `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` DM the bot at the same time, they get **separate**
  sessions (keyed by `chat_id`) but share `OMP_DECK_DEFAULT_CWD` and provider
  quotas.
- **Hosting outside the tailnet**. The bridge always uses Telegram's
  outbound API (no inbound port needed), so it works behind NAT/Tailscale
  without exposing a port. But the deck it talks to is still loopback-only;
  the bridge is the only thing reaching out.
- **Slack / Discord / Matrix**. Same pattern but distinct catalog work —
  filed under deck-future. The bridge supervisor framework is reusable.

## Troubleshooting

**Bridge crashes immediately with "TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN is required".**
The credentials saved in Settings aren't reaching the bridge process. The
deck's managed `.env` writes to `<dataDir>/.env` and the bridge reads from
the same file. Confirm via `cat <dataDir>/.env` (Linux/macOS) or
`type %LOCALAPPDATA%\omp-deck\.env` (Windows).

**Bridge crashes with "TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS must contain at least one numeric Telegram user id".**
You set a username instead of the numeric ID. Get the numeric ID via
[@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot).

**Bot doesn't respond to messages.**
Check logs (expand "Bridge logs" in the card). The most common cause is
the user not being in the allowlist — the bridge replies with
"This omp-deck bot is private." and refuses to process.

**Replies are slow.**
The bridge debounces `editMessageText` calls at `TELEGRAM_EDIT_INTERVAL_MS`
(default 700ms) to avoid Telegram rate limits. Tune in `.env`:

```sh
TELEGRAM_EDIT_INTERVAL_MS=300
```

Lower bound is 250ms — Telegram will reject faster updates.
