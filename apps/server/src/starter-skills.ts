/**
 * Starter-skills installer.
 *
 * The repo ships a small set of omp-native skills under `starter-skills/` at
 * the workspace root. On server boot we copy any starter that isn't already
 * present at `~/.omp/agent/skills/<name>/` into place — idempotent, never
 * overwrites a user-edited target, never touches starters the user has
 * deleted intentionally (we don't track them; absence on disk just means
 * "skip until missing").
 *
 * Rationale: omp doesn't ship a first-party authoring skill, and the upstream
 * `skill-creator` is Claude-Code-bound. Bundling our own native authoring
 * skill removes the bootstrapping gap — a fresh `omp` install with omp-deck
 * gets `/skill:create-skill` immediately, no marketplace dance required.
 *
 * Path resolution:
 * - In dev (`bun --hot src/index.ts`), `import.meta.dir` is
 *   `<repo>/apps/server/src/`, so `../../../starter-skills` resolves to the
 *   workspace's `starter-skills/`.
 * - In bundled prod the resolution still works as long as the build copies
 *   `starter-skills/` next to the bundled entry point (or the env var
 *   `OMP_DECK_STARTER_SKILLS_DIR` overrides). Both knobs are checked.
 *
 * Disable with `OMP_DECK_INSTALL_STARTER_SKILLS=0`.
