/**
 * Tests for the Bun-executable resolution helper (issue #6).
 *
 * The helper is a thin wrapper around `process.execPath` + `Bun.which` +
 * `existsSync`. Three behaviors that matter:
 *   1. Returns process.execPath when it exists (fast path).
 *   2. Falls back to Bun.which("bun") when process.execPath is stale.
 *   3. Throws with both attempts logged when neither resolves.
 *
 * The cache behavior is implicit — we reset between tests with the
 * exported helper.
